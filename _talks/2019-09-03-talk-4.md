A talk is given at [NSF IUCRC, University of Notre Dame](https://asic.nd.edu) 
on the topic of [Intelligent P-QRS-T peak detection for implantable devices](http://asic.pratt.duke.edu/notre-dame).

T-wave alternans (TWA) detection is a very important clinical method and it is ideally
achieved in real-time with very limited computation power and battery capacitor for
implantable devices such as ICD. Most of the existing works either need high computation
power or are not accuracy enough. Using the dynamic time warping (DTW) method offers the
best tradeoff between accuracy and power consumption. We are proposing a method to select
the most efficient setting (for instance: the number of templates for the DTW algorithm) to
achieve the most energy efficient solution for ECG P-QRS-T peak detection.
