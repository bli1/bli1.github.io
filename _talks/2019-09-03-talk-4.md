A talk is given at [NSF IUCRC, University of Notre Dame](https://asic.nd.edu) 
on the topic of [ECG ST-Segment Templates Set Selection with a Recommendation System for Ultra-Low Power Implantable Devices](http://asic.pratt.duke.edu/notre-dame).

• Developed a two-stage system for ECG P-QRS-T peak detection where the online stage subject to computation and power consumption constraint, and applied dynamic time warping algorithm for online T-wave detection.

• Developed a recommendation system as the offline stage to select an efficient templates set which further improves the performance of the online multi-templates algorithm under strict power consumption limitation.
