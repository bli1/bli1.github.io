Projects
======
* Biomedical Image Segmentation Exploiting Computation Power of Blockchain

        • Proposed a novel consensus to exploit the computation power of blockchain for biomedical image segmentation.
        • Designed augmented block header and body, task scheduler in block interval and neural network regularization for the model protection.
        • Embedded watermark in deep learning models which will protect the ownership.

* Real-time Adversarial Attack Target on Speech Recognition System

        • Explored the intriguing properties of speech recognition system which could be critical threats in the real world scenario.
        • The first to propose a real-time adversarial attack scheme for deep learning-based speech recognition models with streaming inputs.

* Automatic Virtual 3D City Reconstruction

        • Proposed an application orientated pipeline to generate a virtual 3D city with relative simple layout design.
        • Applied Pixel2Pixel model to generate building texture from facade design which improves the quality of virtual 3D city model.

* Privacy-Aware Cost-Effective Scheduling Considering Non-Schedulable Appliances

        • Developed a scheduler which aims to minimize the expected sum of electricity cost under the privacy awareness constraint in a smart home system.
        • Developed an iterative alternative algorithm to schedule appliances and rechargeable battery thus protects customer privacy and alleviates the influence of operation uncertainties introduced by non-schedulable appliances.

* Other Projects

        i) Short Video Understanding Challenge: predicted the probability that each user finishes watching and likes a given video based on a content-based, collaborative-based, and knowledge-based dataset.
        ii) Hybrid movie recommendation: suggested movies based on user preference, genre, and theme, and collaborative information, respectively.
        iii) Live basic math auto grader: applied for checking the handwritten basic math equations based on the MNIST classifier.
        iv) Language translator: implemented a statistical machine translation model that applied finite automata, transducer, n-gram language model and hard EM algorithm.
